This course was taught by Andrew NG, it goes over the math behind each algorithm and explains it very thoroughly, then an assignment that tests your understanding should be submitted and graded.

# Main Topics Covered: 
* Supervised Learning
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Neural Networks
  * Support Vector Machines
